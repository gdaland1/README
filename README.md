Calculating the final grade
Introduction: This pseudocode will calculate the final grade with percentages and relative weighted grades.
Requirements: You must have the grades for all your various classes in order to have a fully calculated final grade.
Pseudocode: The user inputs the various weighted percentages for the class; i.e. Homework, Tests, Quizzes, and Final. AFter the user inputs the weighted grade the program creates a table with the varoius identifiers. The program then asks for the individual grades allowing the user to add multiple grades if necessary or stop whenever, running through each different identifier. After the grades are all inserted the program runs the formula necessary to pull out a consolidated final weighted grade.
